                <p class="container-text"> I was born in the south of Brazil and I moved to Utah 2 years ago. I have a
                    dog, his name is Esquilo, which means “squirrel” in English. We named him after the movie Up!
                    I’m a fan of sports, but mostly to watch. My favorite sport is soccer and I love watching all the
                    games, even the ones of small teams that nobody knows about :) I also love playing video games!
                    I play every time I can, in my phone, in my computer, on TV...
                    I am very interested in aircrafts and dinosaurs. I enjoy listening to Podcasts about them and also
                    about curiosities, economy, geography and history. </p>
                <p class="container-text-two"> I graduated in IT almost ten years ago and I have done some endorsements
                    since then, but I am very
                    excited with the opportunity to
                    refresh my skills and learn more in this course. One of the big challenges and goals that I have is
                    to develop my speaking skills in English, although I understand it very well, I know that I have to
                    work in my articulation abilities. I am looking forward to learn more about web development and work
                    with this.
                    I am a very patient and determined person and I believe these aspects will help me accomplish my
                    goals. </p>
